# Flat Finder Application for FDM

Hey! Thanks for checking out this project. This project was commissioned by FDM, a global recruiting company. Me, alongside 6 developers, created this cross-platform full-stack application for consultants to connect, find properties, and relocate. Some of the main feautures include:

-instant messaging

-map view using Google Maps

-search listings

-adding listings

-saving listings

-opening support tickets

And much more. There are two other repositories that you could find, which are flat-finder-server and flat-finder-mobile.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
